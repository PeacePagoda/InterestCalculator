# InterestCalculator
A very simple R shiny app to calculate simple and compound interest based on https://www.thecalculatorsite.com/finance/calculators/compoundinterestcalculator.php and with great help on code from https://www.enricotips.com/post/compound-interest/#compound-interest-calculator-with-a-r-shiny-web-app. This was my first attempt at any R or shiny code.
